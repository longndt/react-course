- Vercel and Netlify deployment configs
- Auto-deploy on git push

**Build Optimizations:**
- Minified bundles with Terser
- Console.logs removed in production
- Vendor code split from app code
- Asset hashing for cache busting
- Brotli/Gzip compression ready

**To Run:**
```bash
cd exercise4-deployment
npm install

# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Learning Outcomes

After completing all exercises, you will understand:

### Performance Optimization
 **Code Splitting**- Reduce initial bundle size with lazy loading
 **Memoization**- Prevent unnecessary re-renders with React.memo, useCallback, useMemo
 **Virtual Lists**- Handle large datasets efficiently with windowing
 **Bundle Analysis**- Analyze and optimize bundle sizes

### Production Deployment
 **Environment Config**- Manage different configs for dev/staging/prod
 **Build Optimization**- Minification, tree shaking, chunk splitting
 **Cloud Deployment**- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Azure
 **SPA Routing**- Configure servers for client-side routing
 **CI/CD**- Automatic deployments from Git

### Best Practices
 **Performance Profiling**- Use Chrome DevTools and React DevTools
 **Type Safety**- TypeScript for better developer experience
 **Error Handling**- Error boundaries and fallback UI
 **Accessibility**- Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
 **Code Quality**- ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode

---

## Prerequisites

All exercises require:
- **Node.js** 18.x or higher
- **npm** 9.x or higher
- **Git** For version control and deployment

Recommended tools:
- **VS Code**with React, TypeScript, and ESLint extensions
- **Chrome DevTools**for performance profiling
- **React DevTools**browser extension

## Performance Comparison Summary

| Metric | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Initial Bundle Size**| 500 KB | 150 KB | 70% smaller |
| **Re-renders (1000 items)**| 1000 | 1 | 99.9% fewer |
| **List Render (10k items)**| 2000 ms | 60 ms | 33x faster |
| **DOM Nodes (10k items)**| 10,000 | 15 | 99.85% fewer |

## Common Pitfalls

### Code Splitting
 Over-splitting (too many tiny chunks)
 Not handling loading states
 Forgetting ErrorBoundary

### Memoization
 Memoizing everything (unnecessary overhead)
 Inline objects/arrays in deps (breaks memoization)
 Not profiling before optimizing

### Virtual Lists
 Not accounting for variable item heights
 Forgetting scroll position restoration
 Not using production libraries for complex cases

### Deployment
 Exposing secrets in frontend env vars
 Not testing production build locally
 Forgetting SPA routing configuration
 Not enabling compression
