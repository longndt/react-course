# Lesson 2: React Components & Hooks

## Overview

**Difficulty** Intermediate **Prerequisites** Lesson 1 completed, TypeScript basics

This lesson covers React component architecture and hooks - the foundation of modern React development. You'll learn to build reusable components, manage state effectively, and create custom hooks for shared logic.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- ✅ Build reusable component libraries with TypeScript
- ✅ Master component composition and props patterns
- ✅ Apply essential React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, useReducer)
- ✅ Create custom hooks for reusable business logic
- ✅ Handle side effects and lifecycle events properly
- ✅ Avoid common Hook mistakes and anti-patterns
- ✅ Debug components with React DevTools
- ✅ Optimize component performance

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, make sure you have:

### Required Knowledge
- ✅ React fundamentals (JSX, component basics)
- ✅ TypeScript basics (types, interfaces, generics)
- ✅ JavaScript ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring)
- ✅ Completed Lesson 1 setup

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Node.js and npm installed
- ✅ VS Code with React extensions
- ✅ React project created (Vite recommended)

### Verification
```bash
# Check your setup
node --version  # Should be 18+
npm --version   # Should be 9+
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

> 🎯 Goal: Master React components and hooks for building complex UIs

### Setup
```bash
# 1. Create new React project (if needed)
npm create vite@latest my-components-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-components-app

# 2. Install additional dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```
