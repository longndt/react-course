###  How to Use Solutions

**Option 1: Reference Only**
- Read through solutions to understand the approach
- Compare with your own implementation
- Learn from the patterns used

**Option 2: Run Locally**
```bash
# Navigate to any exercise folder
cd exercise1-primitives

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the solution
npm start

# Run tests (if available)
npm test
```

**Option 3: Study & Modify**
- Copy solution code
- Experiment with modifications
- Break it and fix it to learn

###  Important Notes

1. **Try First, Then Check:** Attempt the exercises yourself before looking at solutions
2. **Understand, Don't Copy:** Solutions are for learning, not copy-pasting
3. **Multiple Approaches:** Solutions show one way - there may be other valid approaches
4. **TypeScript Strictness:** All solutions use strict TypeScript settings

###  What Each Solution Demonstrates

#### Exercise 1: Primitives
- Proper type annotations
- Type inference
- Array and tuple types
- Type safety benefits

#### Exercise 2: Interfaces
- Interface definitions
- Optional properties
- Readonly properties
- Interface extension
- Practical object typing

#### Exercise 3: Generics
- Generic functions
- Generic interfaces
- Type constraints
- Real-world generic patterns

#### Exercise 4: Utility Types
- Partial, Pick, Omit, Readonly
- Practical use cases
- Type transformations

#### Final: Data Manager
- Integration of all concepts
- Production-quality TypeScript
- Error handling
- Best practices

###  Solution Quality Standards

All solutions follow these standards:
-  TypeScript strict mode enabled
-  Proper type annotations
-  No `any` types (except where absolutely necessary)
-  Descriptive variable and function names
-  Comments explaining complex logic
-  Following best practices from theory section

###  Learning Tips

1. **Compare Approaches:** Check how your solution differs from the provided one
2. **Ask Questions:** If you don't understand something, revisit the theory
3. **Experiment:** Modify the solutions and see what happens
4. **Build Upon:** Use these as starting points for your own projects

###  Next Steps

After completing all exercises and reviewing solutions:
1. Ensure you understand all concepts
2. Can you explain each solution to someone else?
3. Move on to Lab 1: React Fundamentals
