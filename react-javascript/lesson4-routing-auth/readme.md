# Lesson 4: Routing & Authentication

## Overview

**Difficulty** Intermediate to Advanced **Prerequisites** Lesson 3 completed, API integration knowledge

This lesson covers client-side routing with React Router and authentication patterns. You'll learn to build multi-page applications, implement protected routes, handle user authentication with JWT tokens, and create secure user experiences.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- ✅ Implement client-side routing with React Router
- ✅ Create protected routes and authentication guards
- ✅ Handle JWT token authentication and storage
- ✅ Build login/register forms with validation
- ✅ Manage user sessions and logout functionality
- ✅ Implement role-based access control
- ✅ Handle authentication state with Context API
- ✅ Secure API calls with authentication headers

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, make sure you have:

### Required Knowledge
- ✅ React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- ✅ API integration and HTTP requests
- ✅ JavaScript Promises and async/await
- ✅ Basic understanding of authentication concepts
- ✅ Form handling and validation

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Node.js and npm installed
- ✅ React project
- ✅ React Router installed
- ✅ Backend server with authentication endpoints

### Verification
```bash
# Check your setup
node --version  # Should be 18+
npm --version   # Should be 9+
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

> 🎯 Goal: Build a secure multi-page application with authentication

### Setup
```bash
# 1. Create new React project
npm create vite@latest my-auth-app -- --template react
cd my-auth-app

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install react-router-dom

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```
